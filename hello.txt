I was born in 1910, in Paris. My father was a gentle, easy-go- 
ing person, a salad of racial genes: a Swiss citizen, of mixed 
French and Austrian descent, with a dash of the Danube in his 
veins. I am going to pass around in a minute some lovely, 
glossy-blue picture-postcards. He owned a luxurious hotel on 
the Riviera. His father and two grandfathers had sold wine, 
jewels and silk, respectively. At thirty he married an' English 
girl, daughter of Jerome Dunn, the alpinist, and granddaughter 
of two Dorset parsons, experts in obscure subjects â€” paleo- 
pedology and Aeolian harps, respectively. My very photogenic 
mother died in a freak accident (picnic, lightning) when I was 
three, and, save for a pocket or warmth in the darkest past, 
nothing of her subsists within the hollows and dells of mem- 
ory, over which, if you can still stand my style (I am writing 
under observation), the sun of my infancy had set: surely, you 
all know those redolent remnants of day suspended, with the 
midges, about some hedge in bloom or suddenly entered and 
traversed by the rambler, at the bottom of a hill, in the sum- 
mer dusk; a furry warmth, golden midges.
